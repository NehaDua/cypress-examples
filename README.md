> Static site with Cypress examples tested right from the Markdown sources

Live site [glebbahmutov.com/cypress-examples/](https://glebbahmutov.com/cypress-examples/)

## Benefits

- single source of truth for tests and HTML pages. No more copy / pasting
  - Cypress runs tests using Markdown source files via [cypress-fiddle](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-fiddle)
- great development experience with live reload and optimized static build thanks to [Vuepress][vuepress] and Prettier formatting
- JavaScript specs are extracted and published as NPM package `@bahmutov/cypress-examples` after testing against the deployed site and then published to NPM under `@bahmutov/cypress-examples`
- excellent text and code comment search thanks to Algolia
  - [Scrape Static Site with Algolia](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/scrape-static-site-with-algolia/) blog post
  - scrape happens after deploying the docs to GitHub Pages in [.github/workflows/deployed.yml](.github/workflows/deployed.yml) workflow

## Notes

- use "function" syntax in `<script>` tags that need to be live, otherwise Markdown escapes `=>` arrows?!
